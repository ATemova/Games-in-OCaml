### Unpublished games in OCaml
OCaml (Objective Caml) is a powerful functional programming language that excels in type safety and efficiency. It combines functional programming principles with support for imperative and object-oriented styles, offering a versatile approach to software development. OCamlâ€™s strong type system and type inference capabilities reduce the need for explicit type annotations while ensuring robust error checking. It is commonly used in academia and industry for tasks such as compiler construction, formal verification, and financial modeling. With features like pattern matching and immutable data structures, OCaml enables concise, reliable, and maintainable code. Additionally, its interoperability with C and other languages, via the Foreign Function Interface (FFI), allows for integration with existing systems and libraries.
